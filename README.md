### Blog
Simple blog with built-in dark mode. Authoring posts is done with Markdown with some extra features offered by showdown library like automatic links, images sizing and task lists(like github).

Needless to say, this is not an alternative to wordpress or a decent CMS, rather just a demo project to test out Laravel with Tailwind CSS. In 99.999% you are better off using one of the many other PHP Content Management Systems / Blog Engines rather than building your own or using this.
